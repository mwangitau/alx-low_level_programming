## Description

This repository contains a collection of projects and exercises designed to teach low-level programming concepts using the C programming language. The curriculum covers topics such as:

- Basic syntax and data types
- Control structures
- Functions and pointers
- Memory management
- Data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, etc.)
- Algorithms and problem-solving
- Bit manipulation
- File I/O

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- gcc compiler (version 9.3.0 or later)
- Betty style checker

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mwangitau/alx-low-level-programming.git
   ```
2. Change into the project directory:
   ```
   cd alx-low-level-programming
   ```

## Usage

Each project directory contains its own set of C files and a README with specific instructions. To compile and run a C program, use the following commands:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic file_name.c -o output_file
./output_file
```

Replace `file_name.c` with the name of the C file you want to compile and `output_file` with your desired executable name.
